This study examines the interplay among food price fluctuations, gender dynamics, and dietary variety in Tanzania, highlighting women's crucial contribution to food production amidst disparities in access and decision-making authority compared to men. Unpredictable shifts in food prices significantly influence consumer choices, especially in households with limited resources and unequal power dynamics, potentially altering food preferences and exacerbating vulnerability to malnutrition.

Using data from the fourth and fifth waves of the National Panels Survey of Tanzania, analysis of household consumption patterns shows the prevalence of staple foods such as spices, cereals, and vegetables, with affordability of a balanced diet emerging as a critical issue, often surpassing household budgets, especially for low-income families. Despite increased spending on food consumed outside home, accessing nutritious foods remains challenging, exacerbating existing inequalities.

Econometric findings show complex relationship between food prices, dietary diversity, and household characteristics, with gender dynamics further shaping dietary variety, necessitating targeted interventions to address gender disparities and socio-economic factors to enhance food security and nutrition. Such interventions should focus on improving access to affordable, nutritious foods and bolstering market accessibility, enabling policymakers to formulate more effective strategies to ensure equitable access to healthy foods and enhance overall well-being.
